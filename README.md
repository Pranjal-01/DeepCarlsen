# DeepCarlsen - Topics learnt so far

### Reinforcement Learning by Andrew Ng (Coursera)
* Learnt about the basic idea of reinforced learning and what makes it different from supervised learning by an example of a helicopter that was trained by reinforcement learning. 
* Studied an example case of a Lunar Lander game.
* Learnt about algorithm refinement and the limiatations of reinforcement learning.

### CS231n course
* Learnt basics of image classification and how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used for this task.
* Learnt how CNNs can be trained using the cross-entropy loss function and backpropagation, which involves computing gradients and updating the weights of the network.
* Studied about Convolutional Neural Networks and their applications in computer vision tasks. Uses of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, as well as backpropagation and regularization techniques for training CNNs. How the filters in the convolutional layers can be visualized to gain insight into what the network has learned.

### TensorFlow
* TensorFlow is a powerful library used for machine learning tasks. It uses a computational graph approach, where nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent the flow of data. This allows for efficient computations on different hardware.
* In TensorFlow, data is represented as tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays. TensorFlow provides various operations to perform computations on tensors, such as addition, multiplication, and matrix operations.
* TensorFlow makes it easy to build and train machine learning models. I learned how to create a model using the Keras API, add layers to it, and compile it with an optimizer and loss function. I also learned how to train the model using training data and evaluate its performance on test data.
* Transfer learning is a technique where pre-trained models are used as a starting point for solving a similar task. I learned how pre-trained models are used as feature extractors and are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which can save training time and improve performance.

### Review of papers on various types of chess engines
* Learnt about the working of a traditional chess AI like Stockfish which is hardcoded and uses bruteforce techniques to evaluate a position in chess. Read about various aspects of chess algorithms and techniques used in computer chess programs, and topics such as board representation, min-max searching, alpha-beta pruning, null move heuristic, quiescence searching, and static board evaluation functions. Also read about the use of genetic algorithms to optimize board evaluation functions, limitations and challenges faced in determining the best evaluation functions through tournaments. Learnt about the significance of opening move databases in establishing strong positions at the start of a chess game.

I am slightly falling short in terms of weekly progress as I am currently out on a trip. However, I will catch up on the topics till this week by the end of the week.
